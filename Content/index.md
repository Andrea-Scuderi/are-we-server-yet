# Are we _server_ yet?
## Yes! And it's freaking fast!

Swift has a mature and production ready framework in [Vapor](https://vapor.codes), and newer ones like [Hummingbird](https://github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird). These provide everything you’d expect from a web framework, from routing and middleware, to templating, and JSON/form handling. There are packages for everything, and more! For databases, there’s:

- [Fluent](https://github.com/vapor/fluent-kit) a full-fledged ORM.
- [Fluent drivers](https://github.com/topics/fluent-driver), a collection of native drivers for SQlite, Postgres and MySQL.
- [MongoKitten](https://github.com/orlandos-nl/MongoKitten), a fast and pure Swift MongoDB driver

And of course, there is plenty of support for basic web needs, like [logging](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) or [templating](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Plot).
